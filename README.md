# 1. Summary

This project Genrates a 3d model in Fusion 360 of a function rotating around the X-Axis. The model is genrated by connecting multiple cross sections togheter.

## 3.1 Program Theory

The Script genrates the model by creating a cross section thorough the interval of the model.
The cross sections are conneced to one another inorder to create a 3d model of the function.
